# SLA_ArmorPretty

This indicates non-skimpy but girly clothes. Cute and pretty.

# EroticArmor

Relatively less skimpy than bikini armor but somewhat
exposed and suggestive. Belly and thighs exposed or
emphasis on breasts can be categorized here.

# SLA_ArmorSpendex

Spandex, latex... What else do you need for explanation?
People will see her the whole body lines.
People might even notice the shapes of nipples, pussy. Quite
lewd.

# SLA_ArmorLewdLeotard

Very tight lewd leotard type clothes.

# SLA_ArmorCurtain

Every man definitely wants to unveil that curtain. Her privates
will be fully exposed unless she wears underwear. This kind
of clothes is normally SMPfied (If not, there's no point of
using it).

# SLA_ArmorHalfNakedBikini

Cover privates only! You might want to wear a cape to cover
your silky skin. You better be extra careful not to get
stripped. A single slip can easily reveal your secrets.

# SLA_ArmorTransparent

You wear but you don't wear. See-through clothes. Very
revealing and not very different than being naked.

# SLA_ArmorHalfNaked

Cover? Why cover? That's for pussies. A woman must be
ready for sex at any time. A completely whorish outfit could
fit this category.

# SLA_ArmorRubber

Similar to Spandex but more specific. Made of rubber.
Added by Monoman for Bikinifier mod.

covers only breasts. It can be used if armor is divided to

underwear.

Make sure you wear underwear.
